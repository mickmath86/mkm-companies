## Overview

MKM is currently leading a ground-up development in partnership with Lighthouse Church on a 2-acre property in Simi Valley. 

The project includes subdividing church land, raising capital from aligned investors, and guiding entitlement and design phases. With a vision rooted in community impact, the development will offer workforce housing in a high-demand corridor while creating long-term value for the church. 

MKM’s integrated approach covers zoning, financing, development oversight, and eventual disposition or asset management.
