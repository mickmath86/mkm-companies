## Overview

As WCIU transitioned toward online education, MKM was retained to advise and execute the sale of their expansive Pasadena campus. 

The 15-acre site included academic buildings, dormitories, and community spaces. MKM led a nationwide marketing effort, targeting educational operators and institutional buyers. After securing Education First, MKM structured a long-term escrow to support the buyer’s entitlement process and adaptive reuse goals. 

Today, the site is home to over 600 international students—preserving historic architecture while delivering modern educational value.
