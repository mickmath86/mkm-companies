## Overview

As WCIU transitioned toward online education, MKM was retained to advise and execute the sale of their expansive Pasadena campus. 

The 15-acre site included academic buildings, dormitories, and community spaces. MKM led a nationwide marketing effort, targeting educational operators and institutional buyers. After securing Education First, MKM structured a long-term escrow to support the buyer’s entitlement process and adaptive reuse goals. 

Today, the site is home to over 600 international students—preserving historic architecture while delivering modern educational value.

  Keith and his team walked us through an extremely complicated process of sale for our 15+ acre campus. 
  
  
  It is easy to say without Keith’s countess hours, attention to detail and expertise that we would not have completed the sale and could have faced complications from breech of agreement. Keith is personable, knowledgable and fun to work with. He is extremely dedicated to serving his clients. A by product of our contractual relationship was the development of a life long friendship. That friendship goes beyond our Real Estate deal. If I were ever faced with liquidating a large Real Estate holding again, my first call would be to Keith. I highly recommend him as a qualified agent who works from integrity and experience.
