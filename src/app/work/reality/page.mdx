## Overview
Reality Ventura initially planned to retain ownership and lease out their former campus at Goodyear Ave as passive income. But after a lease fell through and the tenant defaulted, MKM was engaged to take over the disposition process. 

Leveraging their deep market network, strategic pricing, and streamlined broker process, MKM brought the property to market, attracting strong investor interest. Within days, a full‑cash offer was secured, and escrow closed in under three weeks. 

MKM’s ability to move decisively under pressure protected their client from further financial strain, while delivering an efficient, high‑value outcome.
