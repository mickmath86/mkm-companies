## Overview
Reality Ventura initially planned to retain ownership and lease out their former campus at Goodyear Ave as passive income. But after a lease fell through and the tenant defaulted, MKM was engaged to take over the disposition process. 

Leveraging their deep market network, strategic pricing, and streamlined broker process, MKM brought the property to market, attracting strong investor interest. Within days, a full‑cash offer was secured, and escrow closed in under three weeks. 

MKM’s ability to move decisively under pressure protected their client from further financial strain, while delivering an efficient, high‑value outcome.

"Working with Keith Mathias and the team at KAM Coastal was an absolute game-changer for our church. From securing a larger facility that perfectly fits our growing needs to expertly negotiating the sale of our previous building, they handled every detail with professionalism, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. Their ability to navigate complex negotiations with both firmness and kindness gave us complete confidence every step of the way. It was a such a relief knowing that KAM was handling every detail, every step of the way. They have been a God-send! We couldn’t have asked for a better team to guide us through this transition!"
